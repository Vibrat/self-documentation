# GraphQL

## 1. Principle

* Hierarchical
A GraphQL query is hierarchical. Fields are nested within other fields and the query is shaped like the data that it returns.

* Product centric
GraphQL is driven by the data needs of the client and the language and runtime that support the client.

* Strong typing
A GraphQL server is backed by the GraphQL type system. In the schema, each data point has a specific type against which it will be validated.

* Client-specified queries
A GraphQL server provides the capabilities that the clients are allowed to consume.

* Introspective
The GraphQL language is able to query the GraphQL serverâ€™s type system.
